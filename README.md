A push button counter is a device or circuit that increases its count by one each time a button is pressed. It typically includes a push button that acts as the input, a counting mechanism such as a digital counter IC or a microcontroller, and a display to show the current count. When the button is pressed, the device registers the input and updates the count accordingly. To ensure accuracy, especially in electronic versions, a debouncing mechanism is often used to filter out noise and prevent false triggers caused by rapid mechanical contacts within the button. Some push button counters also include features like a reset function to clear the count or the ability to count both up and down. The output is commonly shown on a digital display such as a seven-segment display or an LCD screen. This type of counter is widely used in applications where the number of occurrences of a specific event needs to be tracked manually, such as in tally counters, industrial machines, or educational electronics projects.
